~~~~

  A (not so) minimalistic IRC bot written from scratch in ISO99 C.

Why?

  "gangbot", written in ruby: https://github.com/larsivsi/gangbot

Features:
 * Configurable through a config file
 * Timer
 * Fetch titles from URLs
 * Logging to a postgresql database (for integration with stats generation).
 * Decision maker ("eightball")
 * Auto rejoin on kick
 * Auto op of joining users
 * Reload of everything (program code and config)
 * Magic git pull and rebuild

TODO:
 * Package tracking
 * Split lines from server (strtok on newlines)
 * List of OPs in database, !op command
 * Language recognition, automatic translation (using google translate)

Authors:
 * Lars-Ivar Simonsen (larsivsi)
 * Martin Sandsmark (sandsmark)

Required packages (on recent Debian):
  libpcre3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libpq-dev
