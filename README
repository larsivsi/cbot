cbot
~~~~

  A (not so) minimalistic IRC bot written from scratch in ISO99 C.

Why?
  It started as a bad joke, then became a possible replacement for the IRC-bot
  "gangbot", written in ruby: https://github.com/larsivsi/gangbot

Authors:
 * Lars-Ivar Simonsen (larsivsi)
 * Martin Sandsmark (sandsmark)

Required packages (on recent Debian):
  libpcre3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libpq-dev
